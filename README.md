## Hey, I'm Peng Hian

Building open-source tooling for Solana validator operations.

### What I'm Working On

| Project | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| [solana-repro-builds](https://github.com/angpenghian/solana-repro-builds) | Reproducible builds + release pipeline for Solana validator clients (Agave, Jito, Firedancer) |
| [solana-ansible-kit](https://github.com/angpenghian/solana-ansible-kit) | Ansible automation for validator provisioning, hardening, and operations |
| [solana-exporter](https://github.com/angpenghian/solana-exporter) | Prometheus exporter for validator monitoring — 26+ metrics with Grafana dashboard |

These cover the full validator lifecycle: **build verified binaries → deploy infrastructure → monitor performance**.

### Background

Infrastructure and DevOps focused. Currently working on validator/staking operations tooling for the Solana ecosystem.
